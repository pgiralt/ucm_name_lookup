# AGENTS.md — UCM Name Lookup Service

Project context for AI coding agents working on this codebase.

## Overview

A **CURRI** (Cisco Unified Routing Rules Interface) server that provides phone number → display name lookup for **Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM)**. UCM sends XACML 2.0 XML POST requests; the service responds with Permit/Continue decisions, optionally modifying the caller display name via embedded CIXML.

**Calls are never rejected** — the service always returns Permit/Continue.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Framework**: Flask (dev server) / Gunicorn (production)
- **XML parsing**: `defusedxml` (XXE-safe) — never use stdlib `xml.etree` directly
- **Config**: YAML via `PyYAML` (`yaml.safe_load` only — never `yaml.load`)
- **Containerization**: Docker (multi-stage build, non-root user) + Docker Compose

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | Single-file application: config loading, cluster enforcement, CSV loading, XACML parsing, CIXML response building, Flask routes, dev server TLS setup |
| `config.yaml` | Non-sensitive configuration: general settings + multi-cluster definitions (gitignored; copy from `config.yaml.example`) |
| `phone_directory.csv` | Phone number → display name mappings (exact and prefix match types) |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies (pinned to major version ranges) |
| `Dockerfile` | Multi-stage production image with Gunicorn |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Development/deployment compose file |
| `setup_certs.sh` | Certificate helper script — generates self-signed certs or CSRs for mTLS setup |
| `gunicorn.conf.py` | Gunicorn config — auto-detects TLS/mTLS from config.yaml, generates CA bundle before bind |
| `healthcheck.py` | Docker HEALTHCHECK script — auto-detects HTTP vs HTTPS |
| `README.md` | Full user-facing documentation |

## Architecture Decisions

### Single-file application (`main.py`)

All application logic lives in `main.py`. This is intentional for simplicity given the service's focused scope. The file is organized in clear sections with separator comments:

1. **Configuration** — YAML loading, global settings
2. **Cluster Definitions** — `ClusterConfig` dataclass, parsing helpers
3. **CA Bundle Generation** — auto-concatenation of cluster CA files
4. **Client Certificate Helpers** — peer cert extraction, CN/SAN parsing
5. **Flask Application** — `before_request` enforcement hook, routes
6. **Prefix Trie** — efficient longest-prefix phone number matching
7. **CSV Directory Loader** — phone directory ingestion with normalization
8. **XACML Parser** — CURRI request parsing
9. **CIXML Response Builder** — CURRI response construction
10. **Phone Number Lookup** — exact then prefix match strategy
11. **Flask Routes** — `/curri` (POST/HEAD) and `/health` (GET)
12. **Application Startup** — directory loading, dev server TLS

### Configuration via YAML (not environment variables)

Non-sensitive settings are in `config.yaml` (gitignored). The repo ships `config.yaml.example` as a template. Only two env vars remain:
- `CONFIG_FILE` — path to the YAML file (default: `config.yaml`)
- `LOG_LEVEL` — overrides the config file value when set

Sensitive values (TLS private keys) are passed via Gunicorn CLI args or mounted files — never in config.

### Multi-cluster access control

The `clusters` section in `config.yaml` supports multiple UCM clusters. Each cluster independently defines:
- **`allowed_ips`** — IP/CIDR allow-list
- **`ca_file`** — path to the cluster's CA certificate (PEM)
- **`allowed_subjects`** — expected CN/SAN values in client certificates

A request must match **at least one** cluster. Matching means passing **all** of that cluster's defined rules.

**Three-layer enforcement** per cluster (in `_enforce_cluster_access`):
1. IP address check against `allowed_networks`
2. Certificate CN/SAN check against `allowed_subjects`
3. Certificate verification against `ca_subject` (app-layer)

The `ca_file` **must** be a CA certificate (`CA:TRUE`), not a leaf/identity certificate. If a leaf certificate is detected at startup, the application exits with a clear error message directing the user to provide the CA certificate instead. The CA certificate is typically the one that signed the UCM's identity certificate — it can be exported from UCM OS Administration under Security > Certificate Management.

The third check compares the client cert's **issuer** against the CA's subject — verifying the client cert was signed by this specific CA. This is critical in production because Gunicorn uses a single combined CA bundle (`--ca-certs`), so the TLS layer accepts certs from *any* cluster's CA. The app-layer issuer check ensures a client cert signed by cluster B's CA cannot authorize a request as cluster A.

### CA bundle auto-generation

When `ca_bundle_path` is set in config, the app concatenates all unique cluster `ca_file` entries into a single PEM bundle at startup. This file is what Gunicorn's `--ca-certs` should point to.

### Phone number matching

Two strategies, evaluated in order:
1. **Exact match** — O(1) dict lookup
2. **Longest prefix match** — O(m) trie walk (where m = digit length)

Numbers are normalized (strip formatting chars, preserve leading `+`) before lookup.

## Key Protocols

### CURRI / XACML

- UCM sends XACML 2.0 XML with Cisco-specific attribute URNs under `urn:Cisco:uc:1.0:*`
- Key attributes: `callingnumber`, `callednumber`, `transformedcgpn`, `transformedcdpn`
- XACML namespace: `urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:context:schema:os`
- Response embeds CIXML inside XACML via HTML entity encoding
- UCM also sends HEAD requests as keepalive probes — always return 200

### mTLS

- Authentication uses mutual TLS — the only auth mechanism in CURRI
- `setup_certs.sh` automates server certificate generation (two modes: self-signed or CSR)
- `gunicorn.conf.py` auto-detects TLS cert/key and CA bundle; generates the CA bundle before Gunicorn binds
- UCM's `CallManager.pem` is the CA cert to trust
- The service's TLS cert must be imported into UCM's `CallManager-trust` store
- Dev server: cluster `ca_file` entries are loaded into the SSLContext directly
- Production: `gunicorn.conf.py` handles CA bundle generation and `--ca-certs` automatically
- Generated certs go in `certs/` (gitignored)
- In Docker, set `ca_bundle_path` to a writable path (e.g., `/tmp/ca-bundle.pem`) since `certs/` is mounted read-only

## Important Conventions

- **Never reject calls** — always return Permit/Continue, even on errors or empty input
- **`/health` is localhost-only** when clusters are defined (127.0.0.1 / ::1); unrestricted when no clusters are configured. The Docker health check uses a process-level check (scanning `/proc` for gunicorn workers) when mTLS is active, since `CERT_REQUIRED` prevents HTTP connections without a client cert
- **`defusedxml` for all XML parsing** — prevents XXE attacks
- **`yaml.safe_load` only** — prevents unsafe deserialization
- **No secrets in config.yaml** — TLS keys go through Gunicorn CLI or file mounts
- **Logging**: use the `ucm_name_lookup` logger; never log secrets, tokens, or raw cert data
- **TLS minimum**: TLSv1.2 enforced in dev server SSLContext

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create local config from the template
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml

# Run dev server (HTTP)
python main.py

# Run dev server (HTTPS with mTLS — configure clusters in config.yaml first)
# Set tls_cert_file and tls_key_file in config.yaml, plus cluster ca_file entries
python main.py

# Production (gunicorn.conf.py auto-detects TLS/mTLS from config.yaml)
gunicorn main:app

# Docker
docker build -t ucm-name-lookup .
docker compose up
```

## TLS Debug Logging

Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` (env var or `log_level: DEBUG` in config.yaml) to enable detailed TLS diagnostics:

- **Gunicorn startup:** prints TLS config (cert, key, CA bundle, cert_reqs) and dumps every certificate in the CA trust store (subject, issuer, serial, validity). Both CA and leaf certs are listed.
- **App startup:** `_log_ca_bundle_contents()` parses the CA bundle and logs the same details via the `ucm_name_lookup` logger. `_log_trusted_ca_certs()` dumps the SSLContext trust store for the dev server.
- **Per-request:** `_log_cert_details()` logs the client certificate (subject, issuer, serial, validity, SANs). Cluster-matching decisions (IP, subject, issuer/identity) are also logged at DEBUG.

Helper functions in `main.py`: `_format_cert_name()`, `_log_cert_details()`, `_log_trusted_ca_certs()`, `_log_ca_bundle_contents()`.

## Testing Notes

- No test suite exists yet — this is an area for future development
- Key areas to test: XACML parsing, phone number normalization, prefix trie matching, cluster enforcement logic (IP + subject + CA issuer), CA bundle generation
- The `/health` endpoint is useful for quick smoke tests
- For cluster enforcement testing, use `./setup_certs.sh --hostname localhost` to generate test certs
